The Global Terrorism Database™ (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2020 (with annual updates planned for the future). Unlike many other event databases, the GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 200,000 cases. 
            As a first step, we did data wrangling so that to make data more accessible leading to easier analysis with planned..
            We divided the dataset for three types of analysis. 
1.As the first step, perform data wrangling over the raw data. Further, we divide the complete project into three main parts. 
2. Univariate Analysis- We analyzed terrorist attacks year wise, target wise weapon used, hostages, region wise, terrorist group wise, success and failures of terrorist attacks. 
3. Bi-Variate Analysis –We did analysis on region wise number of persons killed vs wounded, year wise number of attacks vs victims and correlation between wounded number of people killed and wounded. 
4. Multivariate Analysis- We did analysis of region wise attack type & target type and identified top 3 organizations with respect to region and country as well as year wise number of victims in different countries due to terrorist attacks.
